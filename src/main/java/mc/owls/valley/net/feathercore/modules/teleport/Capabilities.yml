brief: |
	A player can issue teleport commands towards multiple player targets.
	Teleport commands can be to either:
	- teleport issue to target
	- teleport target to issuer
	A player can:
	- /tpaccept to accept last request
	- /tpaccept <player> to accept specific teleport request
	- /tpdeny to deny last request
	- /tpdeny <player> to deny specific request
	Once a teleport is accepted, it will teleport target player to destination location at the moment of request accept time.
	In order to solve teleports, a task running each <CONFIG_VALUE> ticks will check them
