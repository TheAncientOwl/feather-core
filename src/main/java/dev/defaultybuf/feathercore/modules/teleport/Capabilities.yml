    capabilities: |
			A player can issue teleport commands towards multiple player targets.
			Teleport commands can be to either:
			- teleport issue to target
			- teleport target to issuer
			A player can:
			- /tpaccept to accept last request
			- /tpaccept <player> to accept specific teleport request
			- /tpdeny to deny last request
			- /tpdeny <player> to deny specific request
			Once a teleport is accepted, it will teleport target player to destination location at the moment of request accept time.
			In order to solve teleports, a task running each <CONFIG_VALUE> ticks will check them
